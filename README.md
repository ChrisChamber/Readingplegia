Upon entering the Book Page Screen, this is where the mobility challenged person may take over with the use of the Google Voice Assistant. 
In this screen you are presented with the very first page of the book. To bring up the Google Voice Assistant, you say “OK Google” which brings up the interface, or you may tap the microphone icon to have the same functionality. 
You may navigate the book using the touch screen controls but it is preferred to use voice commands:
o	Turn to next page: “Next page”, “Turn page”, “Turn”
o	Turn to previous page: “Previous page”, “Back”, “Turn back”
o	Place a bookmark on the current page: “Create bookmark”, “Bookmark page”, “Mark page”
o	Go to the bookmarked page: “Go to bookmark”, “Go to bookmarked page”
o	Remove bookmark: “Remove bookmark”, “Delete bookmark”
o	Go to help screen: “Help”
o	Sign out of application: “Sign out”
